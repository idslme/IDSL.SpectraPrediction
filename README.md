# IDSL.SpectraPrediction

Predicting MS/MS spectra for chemical compounds using machine learning and quantum chemistry methods.

For a given list of Name, SMILES and ESI Adduct, we can predict the MS/MS spectra using machine learning and QC methods. Those spectra will be uploaded and shared via the zenodo.org database. 

Post a chemical list to the issues section ( https://github.com/idslme/IDSL.SpectraPrediction/issues ). Example input format is available here https://github.com/idslme/IDSL.SpectraPrediction/blob/main/IDSL_spectra_prediction_input_format_august_2024.csv .
